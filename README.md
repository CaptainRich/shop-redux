## Project Objective
As a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform I want my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API, so that my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem.

For refactoring steps see: 'refactoring_steps.md'.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state:

* When I review the appâ€™s store then I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API.

* When I review the way the React front end accesses the store then I find that the app uses a Redux provider.

* When I review the way the app determines changes to its global state then I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API.

* When I review the way the app extracts state data from the store then I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API.

* When I review the way the app dispatches actions then I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API.
